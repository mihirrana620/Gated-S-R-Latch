# Mixed Signal Circuit Design and Simulation Marathon

# Gated S-R Latch


# Abstract
In This Paper I am going to Design S-R Latch using
Verilog. Design and Implementation will be done in esim and
ngspice software. The SR Latch is a bistable 1-bit memory device
with two inputs, SET and RESET. The RESET input ’R’ resets
the device or causes the output 0 to be produced. The SET input
’S’ configures the device or generates output 1, while the RESET
input ’S’ configures the device or generates output 0. S and R
are the labels for the SET and RESET inputs, respectively. The
main objective was to design a mixed signal circuit for that I
have attached ADC in front of S-R Latch and DAC in behind of
S-R Latch to get input and output in analog form.
